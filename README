Mic Framework is a REST inspired PHP framework. (I would not call it RESTful or it being a PHP REST framework, since I am not Roy Fielding. :) )

This project was started after being interested on REST and mainly based on the idea of Paul James. http://www.peej.co.uk/articles/rmr-architecture.html 
(Summary: "scratching an itch")

There is NO DOCUMENTATION yet. The framework is less than Alpha. Development is mainly done during free time.

HOW TO: (For Apache):
	- copy to a directory accessible by the web server.
	- point all request at that directory to be handled by FrontController.php (a sample .htaccess is included)
	- sample hello world is at [directory]/hello
	- hopefully you will figure out the rest.
